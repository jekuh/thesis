\chapter*{Abstract}
\paragraph*{}
This thesis objective is to develop a method to predict the salience of newspaper articles. We will be working on The New York Times Annotated Corpus and use the fact weather the article was on the Front Page or not as a proxy for salience. That is, we treat the problem as a binary classification problem with the classes Front-Page and non-Front-Page. Three key issues that need to be addressed as part of the thesis are.

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the suitable classification method to tackle the task ?
\item What are effective features for it that can be easily extracted from the data-set.
\item How can we deal with the imbalance training data?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{}
Features will include standard words feature, but should also leverage the rich meta-data that is available (e.g., the topic of the article, its length, or the author). The thesis will include an experimental evaluation, studying the effectiveness of individual features or groups and features, and comparing the methods developed against reasonable baselines (e.g., a random classifier).
